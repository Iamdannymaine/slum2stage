                Nigeria records the world&apos;s highest rate of out-of-school children according to UNICEF. While the absence of financial support is the major contributor of this issue, there are several other factors for childrens&apos;’ low attendance and poor performance in schools.

                While the world aims to achieve quality education for early years, children living in underserved areas and at-risk youth although are the focus, have low interests in going to academic schools. In times when these children have access to education, some of them drop out of school because of low attention span or the pressures from the outside world. Without any sort of programmatic intervention or support, such children have little self-sufficiency, and no chance of creatively participating in their communities.
