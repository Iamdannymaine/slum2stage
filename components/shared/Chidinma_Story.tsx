Chidimma’s mind wanders off – reliving her experiences at home and dreaming of a life under different circumstances. Several times, she imagines herself on a stage, dancing to a crowd or, to her own shadow, twirling and taking giant leaps with the aim of reaching for the stars. On these days, she is snapped back to reality by her teacher’s sudden yell.`}

Chidimma is corrected with compassion by her dance instructor and teammates, further emphasizing the importance of team work. Chidmma is also encouraged to create dance routines of her own which she teaches to the other dancers. This has brought about a significant shift and increase in her confidence and self-esteem.
