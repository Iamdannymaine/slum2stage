Some learn quickly, others struggle, and still others fall somewhere between. Acknowledging this diversity, many educators are recognizing that it is no longer appropriate to approach teaching as a singular, one-size-fits-all endeavour. Recognizing the wide variance that exists within any group of learners, educators are recommending that teachers offer “multiple and varied avenues to learning.”- The Kennedy Center Education Resource.</p><p>Using dance classes as an entry point, but educational and life sufficiency as the end goal, Slum to Stage is retaining and enhancing the interest of children in academic schools, by building safe communities for children and young adults, equipping them with the artistic, behavioural and socio-emotional skills needed to make them better creative and holistic individuals in their communities.</p>"
