   "content": "<p>When asked at 8 years old what she wanted to be, she would have told you a “dancing doctor.” Her answer remains the same.</p>\n<p>After graduating high school, Elyssa spent her time between NYC and Paris, traveling Europe to work with rising choreographers. There, she was exposed to contemporary dance as well as to many diverse processes of creating dance theatre productions. This inspired her to attend London Contemporary Dance School where her days were spent dancing from dawn until dusk, collaborating with composers and traveling the UK as Student Governor to represent all artists who made up London’s small specialist institutions.</p>\n<p>When COVID struck, she helping head a TutuTutoring program that provided a safe, social place for students to complete their online schoolwork, in-person; taught in after-school community art programs; and began research with MindLeaps, a not-for-profit organization that uses dance as a platform to transition vulnerable youth back into an education setting. In 2021, she travelled to Rwanda to complete her Tier II teacher training with this organization. This is the year she learned the difference between working with the community instead of for, a lesson she feels fortunate to have received.</p>\n<p>The last year Elyssa spent working towards completing her Master's Degree with Trinity Laban Conservatory, the birthplace and hub of Dance Science. This is the year she finally understood what being a “dancing doctor” means to her.</p>\n<p>Elyssa is now based primarily in Nepal (as well as in the US and London), where she has joined forces with ECC Nepal. ECC Nepal works to supply students with resources needed to receive an education who otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity due to circumstance, and bring interactive education through teacher training to systems still rooted in rote memorization. There, she will assist with Outreach, and help bring creative movement to its interactive learning programs and classrooms to facilitate students’ engagement with English Language Arts.</p>\n<p>Looking to the future, Elyssa plans on applying to PhD programs, and becoming a licensed Dance/Movement Therapist to better support the work that she is already doing. This may look like: working in rural education, in clinical settings with pediatric patients, or in the studio (her natural habitat) with elite performers.</p>\n<p>Her current research includes: how dance is a Positive Childhood Experience; how rhythmic movement optimizes lateralization in the forebrain (rather, its potential to); how dance promotes both neurological and emotional resilience in adolescents; and the intersect between interactive education models, (new) urban education pedagogies, and principles of Dance/Movement Therapy.</p>"
